## How it works :mag_right:

You can use the ToDoList to save and delete tasks. 
* To add a new task write its name in the "New Item" field and press the :heavy_plus_sign: button. 
* To delete a task click on the checkbox :ballot_box_with_check: and the task will be crossed out and permanently deleted. 

Moreover, you can add different categories of tasks, by just writing /CategoryName after the end of the provided link below. 
Each task is going to be saved in the currently opened category or deleted form it permanently. 

All the data is saved in MongoDB.
